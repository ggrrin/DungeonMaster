The goal of this thesis is to reimplement the Dungeon Master game. Currently there exist several clones of this wellknown game. However, compared to them this thesis focuses on  aspect stated below. The game is implemented in the C# language using .NET platform. Furthermore, the entire engine is designed towards sustainability and scalability - i. e. that by using this engine it is possible to design slightly different game based on the same principles. Especially, it is easy to add new features to the engine. The engine is also prepared for different input formats of levels. Also the rendering layer of the game engine is completely separate. Due to nature of the project the engine can serve as a representative example of a complex program in programming courses.
